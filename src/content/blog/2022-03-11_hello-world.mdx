It's been a while since I last touched my blog and boy have things changed.
I wrote it in 2016 using PHP and MySQL while painstakingly using Material Design to create the interface.
It's been chugging along on a VPS, seldom disturbed, until today.

This is a "Hello, World!" for my new blog site written using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with
[Tina](https://tina.io/) as the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.
Using Tina, I can leverage the power of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to easily create pages using Markdown with
embedded <abbr title="JavaScript XML">JSX</abbr> all styled through [MUI](https://mui.com/).

For example, the contents of this post look like this:

import { CodeBlock } from '../../components/blog/code'

<CodeBlock language='markdown'>
    {props.source}
</CodeBlock>
